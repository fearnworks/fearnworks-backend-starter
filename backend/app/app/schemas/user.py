"""
This module defines the Pydantic models for the User entity. These models are used for data validation, 
serialization and deserialization.

TODO:
1. Define what the UserUpdate model should contain. The current `...` placeholder indicates it's not complete.
2. Explicitly define the fields in the User model instead of using `...`.
3. Validate email format in UserBase.
4. Consider adding more comments to explain what each model represents, especially the difference 
   between `User`, `UserInDB` and `UserInDBBase`.
